Eleven months in Japan; another review:

After a packed month 9 and a calm month 10 it's back to busy again — in a good way though. :)

The semester ended with Japanese exams I took, German exams I helped out with and a lot of farewell events. This was accompanied by preparations for and the start of my trip to Tokyo and ... lo and behold ... the release of Pokémon Go in Japan.  
Up until one and a half weeks ago my smartphone setup consisted of a Samsung I9000 without SIM card running CyanogenMod 11. With some Linux trickery I managed to get the app to start but it was super unstable and unplayably slow. As a consequence I bought a new phone (Asus T00P), caught Pokémon within Matsuyama's extensive areas of public Wifi for some time and now got a data SIM card for the last month.

As of the 8th I'm actually in the midst of my side trip to Mt. Fuji, but I'll put the Tokyo trip as a whole into the next review. 

On to the last month!
