Seven months in Japan; another review:

As I predicted in my [previous post](?a=8a4429e5) I enjoyed an extensive downtime to recharge. :) No traveling, no big events, just lazy day-to-day life. Coming monday lectures will start again; leaving me with less free time, but more externally enforced structure.

In any case, the trip I was in the midst of last post ended without any trouble and was definitely worth it. Good experiences, nice memories and I was able to tick off some new prefectures in the [projects section](?c=projects) (never underestimate the motivational power of lists ^_^').

In the time after the trip occupied myself with [geocaching](static/img/blog/myj15_add13.jpg), parkour training, meeting friends and making new acquaintances. I also felt the desire to do something techy again. After about 4 months of “abstinence“ I tinkered a bit with my [anilist client](https://github.com/IllDepence/anihilist), [peaked](https://github.com/IllDepence/polyglots/tree/master/160403-selfdoc) into the realm of [polyglots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyglot_%28computing%29), — and also aside from tech I invested some time in areas of interest where it seemed long overdue. I guess I kind of dialed down the feeling guilty whenever I sink time into stuff that isn't in any way helping with my Japanese. Good thing. 

On to the next month!
