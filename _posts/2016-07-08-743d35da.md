Ten months in Japan; another review:

I don't have the feeling a whole lot happened. Neither does it feel like it's been a month.

Maybe my [brain just melted](/assets/img/blog/myj15_add17.jpg).

In any case; the end of the semester is coming closer, and with it deadlines for reports, projects and the like. That kept me busy. I also took my first JLPT — N2, went okay, results in early September. Preparations for my last month are also going smoothly. I'll be travelling for about a week (Mt. Fuji, Tokyo, Comiket) and have a work for accommodation arrangement for the remaining time after that.

All in all, everything progressing nicely. Nothing really to complain.

On to the next month!
