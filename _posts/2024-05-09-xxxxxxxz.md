* why do a PhD
    * easy chance to get in
    * Science fan
    * chance to keep dabbling with Python and LaTeX
* observations
    * positive/liked
        * casual atmosphere in academia
        * nice ppl/community, like conferences, research stays, etc.
    * negative/didn’t like
        * CS research still wild west (no rigirous method of establishing knowledge — nice framing and convincing writing is sufficient)
* why want to leave academia
    * need to “sell”
    * not cut out to be a scientist (but was nice to have a peek into this world)
        * global scale competition
        * selbstanspruch (would’ve liked to properly prep, implement, etc.) vs pressure to publish fast, at good venues, etc.

* podcasts
