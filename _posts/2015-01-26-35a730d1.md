I rebuilt the page with [Python](https://www.python.org/), [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), and [Jinja2](http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/dev/).

The [code](https://github.com/IllDepence/sirtetris.com) should be *a lot* cleaner and for me it's more comfortable to type pages and blog entries in Markdown. There are still a few things to sort out but the current state seems presentable. :3
