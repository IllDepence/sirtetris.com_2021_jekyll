Month eight — second to last. D:

The runway lights back home are already switching on — one by one.

Some better balanced I/O compared to last time:

* general
    * was able to take a week off to show my family around here in Tokyo
    * had a peek into an interesting enthusiasts' sphere at the HHKB user meetup vol.2
    * spent the good part of a day in <!-- mixlang:横浜:Yokohama --> and <!-- mixlang:川越:Kawagoe -->
    * rode crazy rollercoasters at Fuji-Q Highland
    * got a Vortex CORE — wasn't able to find a nice case/sleeve/transport option yet, thorugh
* at the institute
    * things are going at a reasonable pace again after last month's "spurt before the deadline"
    * slowly getting more used to bending my work to external requests/compatibility requirements

All in all this month felt like a prolonged transition from *just being in Japan*, over *doing some stuff before it's too late* to *already on my way back*.

On to the last month!
