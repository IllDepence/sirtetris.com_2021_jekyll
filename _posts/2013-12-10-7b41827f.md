On and on it goes ... 97 kanji and 253 words since the last post.

I was quite surprised that I missed the '100 kanji per month' mark by just one day (and just one kanji, acutally — I was at 499 yesterday). Anyway, everything good, no changes as for how I learn and here are my [Anki stats](static/img/blog/anki_stats_131210.png).

Gammar! After I finished my ["grammar rush"](http://moc.sirtetris.com/grammar_rush/) I stated a ["re rush"](http://moc.sirtetris.com/re_rush/). Turned out to be a good strategy so far. No idea what I will do after that though. Maybe start with writing full texts instead of single sentences. Maybe focus on speaking and reduce the time I spent on writing for a while ... we'll see.

Oh and the guys from [Lang-8](http://lang-8.com/) (where I'll write my 100th entry today) are super nice! I found a vulnerability on their site, reported it and they gave me one year premium for my account. :3

As always, for the sake of documentation, these are the [kanji I know so far](static/dl/kanji_checkpoint_5).
