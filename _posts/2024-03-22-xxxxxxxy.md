After having been to Japan [as a student](/s/MYJ15) (exchange year), [for “cultural activities”](/s/NII17) (research internship), [wihout a](/a/f29d4d64) [visa](/a/87696676) (tourism), and [as a temporary visitor](/s/UTYO22) (visiting PhD student under special COVID-19 rules), I’m adding another type of visa and status of residence to the list. This time, it will be a work visa — specifically, a [highly skilled professional visa](https://www.mofa.go.jp/j_info/visit/visa/long/visa16.html) (HSP). Below, I’ll write about the job hunting process, visa acquisition, and preparations for moving.

## 🔍 Job hunting from abroad — fresh master’s graduate  
In early 2019, I had my first experience with hunting for a job in Japan from abroad. The plan back then was to line up a job for when I’d finish my master’s. Going by old notes, I could reconstruct the following.

* Material
    * [Japanese “fill-in form” CV](https://github.com/shigio/rireki-style)
    * [Online CV](https://github.com/pages-themes/minimal)
* Searched on
    * [indeed](https://jp.indeed.com/)
    * [Wantedly](https://jp.wantedly.com/)
    * [Daijob](https://www.daijob.com/)
* Application process
    * 7 job openings I applied for
    * 2 companies I had interviews with <!-- included 職務適正検査 and 課題 -->
    * 1 job offer

The jobs I applied for were in software engineering (NLP, web, etc.), data science, and system administration. The offer I got was for a web development position. In the end though, I also got offered a PhD position in Germany on short notice, [which I ended up taking](/a/25980516).

## 🔍 Job hunting from abroad — PhD with some job experience  
Doing a PhD wasn’t among the “career path” options I had put much consideration into. Because of that, taking the unexpected offer in 2019 didn’t mean to me calling off Japan, but simply putting the move on hold for a bit. Accordingly, I reinitiated the job hunt as the PhD finish line slowly but surely came into view in 2023. Similar to my job hunt in 2019, I primarily searched for industry jobs (rather than a postdoc position). Different from last time, because I had a good four years of full-time employment as a research associate on my CV, I targeted <span class="mixlang"><span class="swap" swap="mid-career recruitment"><span class="inner">中途採用</span></span></span> rather than <span class="mixlang"><span class="swap" swap="new graduate recruitment"><span class="inner">新卒採用</span></span></span>.

As for a rough timeline, about a year before my estimated finishing date, I updated my English LinkedIn profile, set it to “open for work”, and started to occasionally browse [TokyoDev](https://www.tokyodev.com/) to get a first feeling for sought out skills, typical work conditions, etc. During this phase, I got contacted by one bilingual recruiter on LinkedIn and had some helpful discussions. However, since it still was quite some time until I’d be available to start a job, we didn’t get into any application processes.

After about half a year of “passive mode” I switched gears into actively preparing and applying. First things first, I translated my [CV](https://github.com/barraq/pandoc-moderncv) to Japanese — no typical “fill-in form” CV though; kind of felt like a thing for fresh graduates. Second, I looked into search strategies (job platforms, search terms, etc.). Below is a list of the materials I prepared and search paths I took.

* Material
    * [Web + print CV](https://github.com/barraq/pandoc-moderncv)
    * Profiles on job platforms*
* Searched on
    * [TokyoDev](https://www.tokyodev.com/)
    * [japandev](https://japan-dev.com/)
    * LinkedIn*
    * [Green](https://www.green-japan.com/)*
    * [CareerCross](https://www.careercross.com/)*
    * [JREC-IN](https://jrecin.jst.go.jp/)*
    * Company websites
        * German companies (Siemens, Bosch, Volkswagen, etc.)
        * Sponsors of the [Open Source Summit Japan](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/open-source-summit-japan/) (Fujitsu, NEC, NTT Data, etc.) <!-- http://web.archive.org/web/20231130075451/https://events.linuxfoundation.org/open-source-summit-japan/#post-185989 -->
    * The Web

The platform I ended up using the most is [Green](https://www.green-japan.com/). In addition to a messaging system for being “scouted” by recruiters or companies, they also allow companies to “like” your profile, based on which you can accept to have a talk. They also endorse having a <span class="mixlang"><span class="swap" swap="casual talk"><span class="inner">カジュアル面談</span></span></span> as a first step, to ensure a basic mutual understanding. In my experience, <span class="mixlang"><span class="swap" swap="casual talks"><span class="inner">カジュアル面談</span></span></span> are great, but scout messages and likes, while giving a nice confidence boost, are a bit of a mixed bag. Companies and recruiters on Green seem to message and like a bit excessively, which is why I would suggest preparing a template message to check your key conditions with the other side. In my case, even though I clearly stated in my profile that I require visa sponsorship and exclusively search for full-remote jobs, a considerable portion of people that contacted me turned out to not be able to accommodate for that. So, first shoot back with a template message, and only *after* confirmation that key conditions are met, invest time into properly engaging.

Another peculiarity of Green is their podcast, [グリテンラジオ](https://www.green-japan.com/contents/guriten_radio) ([YT](https://www.youtube.com/@guriten_radio)), which was a nice companion for the journey. To give a few example of the contents they discuss:

* General things to consider when looking at job openings: [その求人の募集背景、理解してますか？](https://stand.fm/episodes/64730d47dd3063cef8315ccb)
* Introductions to types of jobs: [データサイエンティストってどんな仕事？](https://stand.fm/episodes/60b42f12a9cdfb1ccf71ff00)
* Nice to know and interesting stuff: [ホワイト500という称号](https://stand.fm/episodes/6559617d96ef49197f7c856e)

Regarding the other platforms, [CareerCross](https://www.careercross.com/) lets you search by required Japanese and English level which is nice for multilingual job seekers, [JREC-IN](https://jrecin.jst.go.jp/) is aimed at academic jobs and a challenge in terms of UI/UX, and [TokyoDev](https://www.tokyodev.com/)/[japandev](https://japan-dev.com/) have lots of job openings that don’t require Japanese.

In addition to job platforms, I also directly searched on company websites. Looking to potentially capitalize on my mother tongue, I checked German companies that might offer the kinds of jobs I’m looking for on Japan. Additionally, because I care about open source, I searched on websites of some of the sponsors of the [Open Source Summit Japan](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/open-source-summit-japan/). In the same vein, I also simply searched the Web for companies embracing/endorsing/appreciating open source. Funnily enough, this last, arguably least sophisticated method led me to an article, [OSS活動に理解のある企業](https://findy-code.io/pick-up/articles/understanding-of-oss_2), which in the end led me to my future employer. ^_^'

Overall, the job hunting process went like this: [**flow diagram of the job search process**](/assets/img/blog/shyuukatsu_2024_sankey.png)

All the interviews were in Japanese and generally a nice experience, expect for one case where the person I talked to seemed to have no interest what so ever in talking to me. Some interviews where quite general, while others delved into more technical detail. Quite interesting was an interview with a consulting firm, which included the discussion of a “case study.“ Accompanying the interview processes, I also was asked to do personality tests and provide referrals by current or previous superiors and colleagues. Two things I learned from the coding test I did, are that my SQL-fu is a bit rusty, and reading technical specifications in Japanese is not really conducive to me coding within a tight time limit.

## 📄 HSP visa acquisition

I decided to aim for an [HSP visa](https://www.mofa.go.jp/j_info/visit/visa/long/visa16.html) because it allows for a fast track to permanent residency. The system grants [points based on qualifications, salary, and age](https://www.moj.go.jp/isa/content/001398892.pdf). Based on the granted points, one can apply for permanent residency after 3 years (70+ points) or 1 year (80+ points) instead of the usual 10. In terms of preparation, I calculated my expected points (80+) and made sure I had proof and documentation for all the stuff I was banking on getting points for. In the end, I got the 80+, but the approval took quite a bit longer than expected based on reference data from previous years.

* **Visa timeline**
    * 03/03: submit <span class="mixlang"><span class="swap" swap="Certificate of Eligibility — conformation by the immigration authorities that you are eligible to enter the country"><span class="inner">CoE</span></span></span> application to immigration authorities  
      (last year had an average processing time of 22 days for my visa type ([ref](https://www.moj.go.jp/isa/content/001396025.pdf)) → roughly calculate 03/25 issue)
    * 03/28: additional documents requested (work contract + proof of employment in Germany)
    * 04/09: submit requested additional documents
    * 05/10: submit visa application (except CoE) to consulate
    * 05/24: immigration authorities say “CoE review process in and of itself finished” (but CoE not yet issued)
    * 06/03: CoE issued
    * 06/04: submit CoE to consulate (digitally)
    * 06/11: pick up visa at consulate
    * 06/14: enter the country
    * 07/01: first day at work (shifted from originally planned 06/01)

oh well, in the end it all worked out, which means if all goes well i’ll be able to apply for permanent residence in July 2025. Another process that is likely to take a while. ^_^'

## ✈ moving prep

Lastly, beyond being able to enter the country, one needs a place to live, and stuff needs to get there. Below few quick notes on the moving process.

* Finding an apartment  
  My SO and me looked for places on [SUUMO](https://suumo.jp/), [at-home](https://www.athome.co.jp/), [HOME'S](https://www.homes.co.jp/), and through real estate agents. The latter is what eventually worked out (\*sound of crying wallets\*).
* Getting rid of stuff  
  I sold technical equipment on ebay, [kleinanzeigen](https://www.kleinanzeigen.de/), disposed of old hard disks [after wiping wiping](/assets/img/blog/hdd_shred.jpg) ([ShredOS](https://github.com/PartialVolume/shredos.x86_64), [shred](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/shred.1.html)), and sold books on [momox](https://www.momox.de/).
* Luggage management  
  I divided everything I brought into three categories.
    * Bag-pack + carry on suitcase: essential papers, irreplaceable items of personal significance, standard travel stuff 
    * Check-in suitcase: stuff useful to have right away after arrival (replaceable everyday use items like clothes and tech)
    * Ship by post: stuff for which delayed arrival is unproblematic (easily replaceable possessions like books)
* Official stuff
    * Deregister residence
    * Leave health insurance
    * Terminate subscriptions
