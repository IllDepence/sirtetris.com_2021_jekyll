The [first implementation](/a/132c1dbb) of my movielist made use of IMDBPHP, a third party API thingy. I now finally got rid of it and wrote my own code. Not that IMDBPHP would have been bad in any way, it just was way to heavyweight for what I used it for. Additionally I created a little HTTP [service](/c/service) which can be fed with an IMDb ID and a specification of information type via GET parameters to receive a plain text answer.  
Since both the service and parts of the movielist use fsockopen() — which is disabled on bplaced.net — I have to host them on square7.ch.  
Besides: Vim syntax highlighting (with background set to dark) is just sexy. &lt;3
