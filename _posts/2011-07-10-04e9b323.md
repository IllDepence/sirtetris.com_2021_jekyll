A fortunate coincidence — or maybe a great estimation of what would be suitable for my person. : )

I mostly read textbooks, in the majority of cases about philosophy. Somehow novels aren't the kind of books that usually catch my attention. Sadly, because ... not enjoying something is in some way missing something.  
I loved the *Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy* series, enjoyed Stefan Zweig's *The Royal Game* and occasionally read manga. But the rest of what I've read so far ... Precht, Dawkins, Postman, Watzlawick, Nietzsche, etc. — therefore I'm always keen on finding novels I like.

Last saturday a friend of mine lent me *The Elegance of the Hedgehog* (amazon[.com](http://www.amazon.com/dp/1933372605)/[.de](http://www.amazon.de/dp/3423138149)). She once cited a passage from the book in an e-mail. It looked promising, I got interested. As it turned out this book — at least in my opinion &mdash; is *just perfect* for a person which enjoys reading analytical, philosophical works. It has a touch of such works, yet tells a story, keeps you interestend, is written gorgeously and altogether is just a wonderful book. \*recommended\*
