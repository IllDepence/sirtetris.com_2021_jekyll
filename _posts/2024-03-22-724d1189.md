Next update on Korean studies after over half a year of mostly stagnation.

Shortly after the [last update](/a/742216f0), Korean studies completely went on the back burner. This mostly was due to other things requiring my attention, but I guess another partial factor is that the stubborn “monolingual” sentence mining approach I took with [바른 한국어](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUa1FE1E3AYs975HVvtSJbAGvHT0FwhlB) just wasn’t working out as I had hoped. In hindsight, I think prioritizing grammar over vocab would’ve been better for me, such that I acquired the basic tools to construct sentences and look up words on the fly as needed.

In any case, over the last weeks I gradually got back into studying again—first working away the pile of Anki cards that had built up, then seeking out new resources and ways to study. In particular, I watched some videos on [Talk To Me In Korean](https://www.youtube.com/@talktomeinkorean) (TTMIK) and [ジニ JINI TV](https://www.youtube.com/@jinitv) resulting in a few grammar aha moments. Also, I added the Anki deck [Korean Vocabulary by Evita](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/4066961604) to my routine.

So far, I think loosening up the study regime a bit was a good trade-off to make. TTMIK comes from an “English speaker’s perspective”, so there’s a non-zero chance I miss out on some connection to Japanese grammar that would make it easier for me to grasp or remember. But if a grammar point clicks for me and expands by range of expression, so be it. JINI TV provides a “Japanese speaker’s perspective”, but contains Korean pronounced by a non-native. Also not ideal, but as long as it’s not my main source of Korean listening input, it shouldn’t be a problem. Lastly, the Anki deck by Evita has only recognition cards (no recall) and no example sentences, but that’s better than nothing if I don’t have the time/language level/functioning routine for sentence mining at the moment.

With the bits and pieces of new grammar and vocab under my belt, I started to write at least one Korean post per day HelloTalk. A tool that has proven helpful for that is the [Dongsa Korean Verb Conjugator](https://koreanverb.app/). For looking up words, I haven’t found an offline solution yet and still use [korean.dict.naver.com](https://korean.dict.naver.com) and [hanja.dict.naver.com](https://hanja.dict.naver.com).

Lastly, regarding content, I’m still on the lookout for TV series, movies or similar for extra motivation. What I did find is the podcast [KJしゃべラジ-韓国語＆日本語でおしゃべりラジオ-](https://stand.fm/channels/62158af162fdf0d8008e3211) that I sometimes listen to.

Fingers crossed I manage to maintain some form of consistent progress from here on.
