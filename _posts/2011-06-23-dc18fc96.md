Uhm, yes ... I had to change it again. To be more precise: I built the site again pretty much from scratch. It's as if everytime I remake my page and use it for some time, I find new flaws and the desire to start all over again rises. ^^  
This time I didn't make any major steps concerning technology â€” only added a little javascript. The look however changed quite a bit: centered again, uniform color, a picture in the header, different categories and no more name or title (like *&amp;code* before). Greatest changes however were made concerning content. I overhauled most of it.

Oh and: old entries are old. I'm not going to import them ... this is gonna be kind of a new beginning. : )
