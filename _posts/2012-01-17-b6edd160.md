On today's schedule:  
light exercises in JavaScript, regular expressions and Vim. :D

I finally managed to grant my [Elfen Lied content base](?c=el) a proper functionality to load content on demand. The full page contains images worth >60MB. Combined with slow speed due to free webspace you end up with a browsing experience of pure *"meh ..."*. Until now I only hid collapsed content and displayed it on demand. Now expanding and collapsing really means loading the content and removing it. Not only hiding and displaying while loading it anyway.
