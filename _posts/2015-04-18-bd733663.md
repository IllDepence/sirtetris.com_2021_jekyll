101 kanji, 231 words, 36 days; [Anki stats](static/img/blog/anki_stats_150418.png), [kanji so far](static/dl/kanji_checkpoint_18).

Less than 45 days was doable. :)

I'm considering to stop seaching for new kanji/vocab each day and repurpose that time for focussed reading practice, collecting new kanji/vocab on the way. This would, I expect, slow down my kanji progress significantly. But I feel that I've reached a point where the hassle of blindly seaching for new words to learn, solely for the purpose of getting those damn <span class="mixlang"><span class="swap" swap="jōyōkanji"><span class="inner">常用漢字</span></span></span> done isn't really worth it anymore.

When reading Japanese it isn't the kanji that hold me back, it's grammar, phrases, compounds, etc. I presume simply reading a lot while looking up the stuff I don't understand will benefit my reading comprehension way better than continuing what I've done up until now. Everything new I come across this way will have the *huge* benefit of being learned with a context — which is kind of taking my 'learn kanji in the context of words' approach one step further: 'learn vocab and grammar in the context of continuous text'.
