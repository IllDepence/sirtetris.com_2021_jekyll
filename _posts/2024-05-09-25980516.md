Over the course of the past five years, I pursued a PhD while working as a research associate at a university. In this post I want to briefly reflect on the experience.

For a bit of context: here in Germany, bachelor and master students are *students* — take lectures, write exams, pay administrative/tuition fees —, whereas people pursuing a PhD are part of the teaching and research body — give lectures, create/proctor/grade exams, have a full-time\* contract and receive a salary. Accordingly, they are not referred to as “&lt;something&gt;-Student” in German, but rather “Doktorand”.  
<small>\*Full-time contracts are common in computer science, but in other fields, such as biology, I hear it is more likely one gets a 50% contract and salary while basically being expected to shoulder a 100% workload. Furthermore, there might be fields where doing a PhD involves *taking* (instead of giving) lectures/courses, but I haven’t heard of cases like that so far.</small>

## A story all about how, my life got flipped-turned upside down ...


I wasn’t [pushed around on a basketball court](/assets/img/blog/phd_fresh_prince.gif), but the prospect of doing a PhD nevertheless came quite sudden and brought a drastic change to my life plans.
Towards the end of my master’s thesis, I was set to move to Japan and had landed a job that would sponsor my work visa. A few days after receiving the job offer, though, I was asked by my thesis supervisor if I’d join him in the lab he’d switch to do to a PhD.

* why do a PhD
    * easy chance to get in
    * Science fan
    * chance to keep dabbling with Python and LaTeX
* observations
    * positive/liked
        * casual atmosphere in academia
        * nice ppl/community, like conferences, research stays, etc.
    * negative/didn’t like
        * CS research still wild west (no rigorous method of establishing knowledge — nice framing and convincing writing is sufficient)
* why want to leave academia
    * dislike of perceived need to overly “sell” one’s research ideas (instead of objectively describing them)
    * not cut out to be a scientist (but was nice to have had a peek into this world)
        * global scale competition
        * selbstanspruch (would’ve liked to properly prep, implement, etc.) vs pressure to publish fast, at good venues, etc.

* podcasts
