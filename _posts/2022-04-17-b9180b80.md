A bit more than a year ago [I decided](/a/5797082c) to create a new flashcard deck for recognition only vocab. The deck mostly grew through words I picked up in books, as well as a steady stream of me remembering stuff I could already read (but not write) through natural exposition over the years. The deck grew, containing [100](/a/5797082c) new kanji, [200](/a/579b082d), [300](/a/579f082e), and most recently [400](/a/57a3082f). Imminent checkpoints ahead always sparked quick bursts of actively looking out for words with new kanji to add—a mode of operation that [I had pursued](/a/bd733663) until I reached 1,800 recognition+recall kanji.

For the first recognition only [100+](/a/5797082c) post I came up with the theme of a [Magicka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magicka) mage casting a spell, giving me +100 on my kanji reading stat. As cards and therefore new kanji accumulated quickly, it felt like a fitting theme. At that point I also already created the +200, +300, and +400 images, which were weirdly motivating in and of themselves when a new checkpoint was close. During the quick bursts of actively looking for words with new kanji to add, I ventured into a variety of categories.

* Chinese food: <span class="mixlang"><span class="swap" swap="dumplings"><span class="inner">餃子</span></span></span>, <span class="mixlang"><span class="swap" swap="dumplings"><span class="inner">焼売</span></span></span>, <span class="mixlang"><span class="swap" swap="dumplings"><span class="inner">小籠包</span></span></span>, ...
* Animals: <span class="mixlang"><span class="swap" swap="mouse"><span class="inner">鼠</span></span></span>, <span class="mixlang"><span class="swap" swap="tanuki"><span class="inner">狸</span></span></span>, <span class="mixlang"><span class="swap" swap="koi"><span class="inner">鯉</span></span></span>, <span class="mixlang"><span class="swap" swap="salmon"><span class="inner">鮭</span></span></span>, <span class="mixlang"><span class="swap" swap="falcon"><span class="inner">鷹</span></span></span>, <span class="mixlang"><span class="swap" swap="hawk"><span class="inner">鷲</span></span></span>, <span class="mixlang"><span class="swap" swap="giraffe"><span class="inner">麒麟</span></span></span>, ...
* Place names: <span class="mixlang"><span class="swap" swap="Saitama"><span class="inner">埼玉</span></span></span>, <span class="mixlang"><span class="swap" swap="Ibaraki"><span class="inner">茨城</span></span></span>, <span class="mixlang"><span class="swap" swap="Tochigi"><span class="inner">栃木</span></span></span>, <span class="mixlang"><span class="swap" swap="Shiga"><span class="inner">滋賀</span></span></span>, <span class="mixlang"><span class="swap" swap="Nara"><span class="inner">奈良</span></span></span>, <span class="mixlang"><span class="swap" swap="Pyongyang"><span class="inner">平壌</span></span></span>, ...
* More food and cooking stuff: <span class="mixlang"><span class="swap" swap="ladle"><span class="inner">杓子</span></span></span>, <span class="mixlang"><span class="swap" swap="to roast"><span class="inner">炙る</span></span></span>, <span class="mixlang"><span class="swap" swap="hot sake"><span class="inner">燗酒</span></span></span>, ...
* Colors: <span class="mixlang"><span class="swap" swap="orange"><span class="inner">橙</span></span></span>, <span class="mixlang"><span class="swap" swap="indigo"><span class="inner">藍</span></span></span>, <span class="mixlang"><span class="swap" swap="dark blue"><span class="inner">紺</span></span></span>, ...
* Chinese zodiacs (干支): <span class="mixlang"><span class="swap" swap="rabbit"><span class="inner">卯</span></span></span>, <span class="mixlang"><span class="swap" swap="dragon"><span class="inner">辰</span></span></span>, <span class="mixlang"><span class="swap" swap="snake"><span class="inner">巳</span></span></span>, <span class="mixlang"><span class="swap" swap="rooster"><span class="inner">酉</span></span></span>, <span class="mixlang"><span class="swap" swap="dog"><span class="inner">戌</span></span></span>, <span class="mixlang"><span class="swap" swap="boar"><span class="inner">亥</span></span></span>, ...

Around the [400](/a/57a3082f) mark I then noticed another checkpoint in reach. The roughly 2,500 kanji in my cards at that point covered 96% of the 2,136 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C5%8Dy%C5%8D_kanji"><span class="mixlang"><span class="swap" swap="regular-use kanji"><span class="inner">常用漢字</span></span></span></a>—a list that over time gradually felt less and less relevant after noticing that I’d quite frequently stumble upon words containing kanji new to me from outside of the list, like <span class="mixlang"><span class="swap" swap="tooth pick"><span class="inner">爪楊枝</span></span></span>, <span class="mixlang"><span class="swap" swap="apology"><span class="inner">お詫び</span></span></span> and <span class="mixlang"><span class="swap" swap="miso"><span class="inner">味噌</span></span></span>, while words using new kanji from within the list seemed to cover comparatively niche topics, like <span class="mixlang"><span class="swap" swap="strips of dry/elevated land between (rice) fields"><span class="inner">畔</span></span></span>, <span class="mixlang"><span class="swap" swap="imperial decree"><span class="inner">詔</span></span></span>, and <span class="mixlang"><span class="swap" swap="associate judge"><span class="inner">陪席</span></span></span>. However, with less than 100 kanji to go for a list of 2,136 the completionist in me took over.

Because I knew that for some of the kanji I would only find obscure words when looking for myself, I went through the list with a few natives, asking for the first word that came to their mind when seeing each character. With all the new flashcards added I’m now at 6,824 recognition + recall cards (covering 2,146 kanji) and 524 recognition only cards (covering 462 kanji), adding up to a total of [2,608 kanji](/assets/dl/ro_kanji_checkpoint_max). Their accumulation over time looks as follows.

With this short renaissance of actively looking for words with new kanji having reached somewhat of a conclusive checkpoint, I think it is now once more time to [~~Purge An Old Meme~~ put the practice to rest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo5RU83XCC0), close this chapter and go back to a natural influx of new stuff through exposition in daily life.
