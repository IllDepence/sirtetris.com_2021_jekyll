100 kanji, 420 words, 115 days; [Anki stats](/assets/img/blog/anki_stats_150811.png), [kanji so far](/assets/dl/kanji_checkpoint_19).

Final spurt? Not really. Apart from the last two weeks — where I actively searched for new kanji to get from 1880 to 1900 — considerations of [previous checkpoint](/a/bd733663) were put into practice. I got most of my newly acquired vocab from <span class="mixlang"><span class="swap" swap="non animated Japanese TV series"><span class="inner">ドラマ</span></span></span>, manga and interaction with Japanese people.

If I kept my current kanji pace I'd reach full Jōyō somewhere in the second quarter of next year. :D We'll see ... kanji isn't the main focus of active progression anymore.
