Month three — halfway through; another review:

Anki wasn't that great ([stats](static/img/blog/anki_stats_180118.png)) but at least still better than in the first month — and I finally got around doing some badly needed maintenance on my deck. Apart from Japanese study, slow but steady progress across the board. Nothing to complain. :)

Again, an attempt to convince myself that I'm actually making good use of my time here:  

* general
    * was at a sentō on christmas eve; on the way back I heard a girl's voice from a near high-rise building <span class="mixlang"><span class="swap" swap="&quot;Santa Claaaus! Please come to our hooouse!&quot;"><span class="inner">「サンタ様ー！来てくださーい！」</span></span></span> :3
    * was shocked to learn that Japan introduced compulsory wearing of seat belts for rear passangers [in 2008](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%82%B7%E3%83%BC%E3%83%88%E3%83%99%E3%83%AB%E3%83%88#%E5%BE%8C%E9%83%A8%E5%BA%A7%E5%B8%AD%E3%82%B7%E3%83%BC%E3%83%88%E3%83%99%E3%83%AB%E3%83%88%E7%BE%A9%E5%8B%99%E5%8C%96) *and there's no penalty for non expressway roads* °_°
    * rode my bycicle to work, passed a <span class="mixlang"><span class="swap" swap="mama-chari (bicycle type with front basket often used by mothers)"><span class="inner">ママチャリ</span></span></span> and thought I heard a <span class="mixlang"><span class="swap" swap="&quot;UuUuUi! Earthquake alarm!&quot;"><span class="inner">「ウゥウゥウイッ！地震です！」</span></span></span> — but there was a kid on the back of the <span class="mixlang"><span class="swap" swap="mama-chari"><span class="inner">ママチャリ</span></span></span> gaming away on some handheld console so I could've misheard some game sounds. Stopped anyway to see what happens — nothing happened so I concluded it was some game. [Turned out it actually was an earthquake alarm](https://rocketnews24.com/2018/01/05/1004451/).
    * saw the last Jedi
    * was in Niigata
    * had a very Japanese New Year with <span class="mixlang"><span class="swap" swap="Kōhaku"><span class="inner">紅白</span></span></span>, <span class="mixlang"><span class="swap" swap="koshi-toshi soba"><span class="inner">年越しそば</span></span></span>, <span class="mixlang"><span class="swap" swap="zō-ni"><span class="inner">雑煮</span></span></span>, <span class="mixlang"><span class="swap" swap="hatsumōde"><span class="inner">初詣</span></span></span> and <span class="mixlang"><span class="swap" swap="ekiden"><span class="inner">駅伝</span></span></span> — sneaked in a German tradition with [Dinner for One](http://www.spiegel.de/international/zeitgeist/dinner-for-who-germany-s-new-year-procedure-a-418781.html)
    * watched the entire <span class="mixlang"><span class="swap" swap="karuta master and queen championship"><span class="inner">かるた名人・クイーン戦</span></span></span> live on <span class="mixlang"><span class="swap" swap="Nico Nico Dōga"><span class="inner">ニコ動</span></span></span>
    * visited the <s>Tokyo</s> Saitama [flood prevention underground thingy](static/img/blog/nii_add_05.jpg)
    * I'm finally getting back into sports after a 5 month break due to an injury
* at the institute
    * had a bit of fun with face recognition and line detection (OCR)
    * doing a lot of very conceptual work at the moment
    * the elevetors sometimes say <span class="mixlang"><span class="swap" swap="&quot;Sorry for the wait&quot;"><span class="inner">「お待たせしました」</span></span></span> and <span class="mixlang"><span class="swap" swap="&quot;Please enter&quot;"><span class="inner">「どうぞお乗りください」</span></span></span>

All in all, satisfactory. Oh and the constant feeling that I could/should do more is gone. (:

On to the next month!
