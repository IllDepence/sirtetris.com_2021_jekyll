Month three — halfway through; another review:

Anki wasn't that great ([stats](static/img/blog/anki_stats_180118.png)) but at least still better than in the first month — and I finally got around doing some badly needed maintenance on my deck. Apart from Japanese study, slow but steady progress across the board. Nothing to complain. :)

Again, an attempt to convince myself that I'm actually making good use of my time here:  

* general
    * was at a sentō on christmas eve; on the way back I heard a girl's voice from a near high-rise building <!-- mixlang:「サンタ様ー！来てくださーい！」:&quot;Santa Claaaus! Please come to our hooouse!&quot; --> :3
    * was shocked to learn that Japan introduced compulsory wearing of seat belts for rear passangers [in 2008](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%82%B7%E3%83%BC%E3%83%88%E3%83%99%E3%83%AB%E3%83%88#%E5%BE%8C%E9%83%A8%E5%BA%A7%E5%B8%AD%E3%82%B7%E3%83%BC%E3%83%88%E3%83%99%E3%83%AB%E3%83%88%E7%BE%A9%E5%8B%99%E5%8C%96) *and there's no penalty for non expressway roads* °_°
    * rode my bycicle to work, passed a <!-- mixlang:ママチャリ:mama-chari (bicycle type with front basket often used by mothers) --> and thought I heard a <!-- mixlang:「ウゥウゥウイッ！地震です！」:&quot;UuUuUi! Earthquake alarm!&quot; --> — but there was a kid on the back of the <!-- mixlang:ママチャリ:mama-chari --> gaming away on some handheld console so I could've misheard some game sounds. Stopped anyway to see what happens — nothing happened so I concluded it was some game. [Turned out it actually was an earthquake alarm](https://rocketnews24.com/2018/01/05/1004451/).
    * saw the last Jedi
    * was in Niigata
    * had a very Japanese New Year with <!-- mixlang:紅白:Kōhaku -->, <!-- mixlang:年越しそば:koshi-toshi soba -->, <!-- mixlang:雑煮:zō-ni -->, <!-- mixlang:初詣:hatsumōde --> and <!-- mixlang:駅伝:ekiden --> — sneaked in a German tradition with [Dinner for One](http://www.spiegel.de/international/zeitgeist/dinner-for-who-germany-s-new-year-procedure-a-418781.html)
    * watched the entire <!-- mixlang:かるた名人・クイーン戦:karuta master and queen championship --> live on <!-- mixlang:ニコ動:Nico Nico Dōga -->
    * visited the <s>Tokyo</s> Saitama [flood prevention underground thingy](static/img/blog/nii_add_05.jpg)
    * I'm finally getting back into sports after a 5 month break due to an injury
* at the institute
    * had a bit of fun with face recognition and line detection (OCR)
    * doing a lot of very conceptual work at the moment
    * the elevetors sometimes say <!-- mixlang:「お待たせしました」:&quot;Sorry for the wait&quot; --> and <!-- mixlang:「どうぞお乗りください」:&quot;Please enter&quot; -->

All in all, satisfactory. Oh and the constant feeling that I could/should do more is gone. (:

On to the next month!
