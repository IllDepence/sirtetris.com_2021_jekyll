Two months in Japan; another review:

I feel like I've reached a solid base on which to build upon in a lot of aspects. After selling my DSLR prior to coming to Japan in order to switch to a more portable system I finally bought a [new camera](static/img/blog/myj15_add6.jpg). I've received my first scholarship money resulting in me financially operating from my Japanese bank account instead of my German credit card. A larger project which is part of my master's course at the University of Freiburg is finally finished leaving me with more free time. I've kind of sort of developed a food routine or rotation of different foods for mornings and evenings. And probably most important of all: social connections start to feel real. The <span class="mixlang"><span class="swap" swap="taisōbu"><span class="inner">体操部</span></span></span> (gymnastics club) people are happy each time I join their training, the [boardgames](static/img/blog/myj15_add9.jpg) meeting I've attended once so far looks promising and tandem language learning is fun as always. :)

A few random highlights: I ate [whale meat](static/img/blog/myj15_add8.jpg), managed to corrupt my Ubuntu system and had to [set up a new one](static/img/blog/myj15_add7.jpg), had fun at [Halloween](static/img/blog/myj15_add10.jpg), am getting into Geocaching and competed at a [settlers of catan tournament](static/img/blog/myj15_add11.jpg). All in all, a bunch of positive developments.

On to the next month!
