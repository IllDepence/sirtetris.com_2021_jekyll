[God mode](static/img/blog/keima_god_mode.png) activated. :)  
Exactly one month ago I wrote 「漢字 — 200+」 and since then addded 280 new words using 100 new kanji to my Anki deck. That means I learned more than nine words per day — which is pretty awesome compared to what I did before.  
Looking at my [Anki stats](static/img/blog/anki_stats_131003.png): I learned every day and added new vocab on 25 of 30 days. On average I review 115 cards in 52 minutes. I require additional time to find new kanji, create mnemonics, find useful new vocab using those kanji, etc. So I guess it's reasonable to assume that I spend about 1.5 hours a day on Japanese vocab. Doesn't sound like an awful lot of time and yet the benefit is quite awesome. :)

The most important thing to note is, that I really made it a habit to go through all due Anki cards in the morning/early afternoon, add new kanji in the evening and go through these a bit later. If you're used to it, it's no burden.  
Further changes in my learning approach: I use [Tagaini Jisho](http://www.tagaini.net/) *a lot* more than before. And I more often use word frequency lists to find new useful vocab. Apart from that ... I sometimes find it useful to not sit in from of my computer with all its distractions when learning, so I use AnkiWeb on my Kindle which works fine.

As always, for the sake of documentation, these are the [kanji I know so far](static/dl/kanji_checkpoint_3).
