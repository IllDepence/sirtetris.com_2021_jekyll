#### Stage 1
The "News Feed" is divided into "Top news" and "Most recent".  
The so called "Top News" are a filtered version of all the news that come up. What is presented to you is, among other things I guess, based on the amount of likes and replies a status update or other news item gets.  
If you don't want facebook to decide what news you get to see: only view "Most recent"

#### Stage 2
The news feed section "Most recent" has the option "Show posts from:" which can be set to "Friends and pages you interact with the most" or "All of your friends and pages".  
Again ... Facebook filters. This time according to the amout of interaction you had with the persons in your contact list via Facebook.

#### Stage 3
For every person in your contact list you lately have a so called subscription. The default setting for such a subsbsription is "Most Updates". (Options are "All updates", "Most Updates" and "Only Important").  
And again: why should the user care about all updates and decide for himself, what is important to him and what is not? Let's change the news feed and again cut out stuff that we — Facebook — think is unimportant. **Argh, I hate it!**

‌  
Personalized filtering is an interesting thing and, in my humble opinion, even necessary in our days of information oversupply. But I really can not stand it when service providers ***by default*** hold back information, filter your input, infantilize their users.

To be fair: it's nice that Facebook at least let's you change the filtering &mdash; I don't want to know how much filtering is done without us knowing about it. But neither have I stumbled across an option to set the default for all subscriptions to "All updates" yet, nor am I inclined to change this for all my Facebook contacts manually.

#### Update:
What the ...?! Less than two hours after I blogged this:
