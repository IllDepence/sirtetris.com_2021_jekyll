***Level up!*** for the cinephile. I rebuilt/improved my movielist. : )

The old list contained title, year and duration in a rather mediocre conceived notation. Now I note title, year and IMDb id. The first two to still have something human readable and independent from external sources, the third to gather all further data.

To access the IMDb page I use [IMDBPHP](http://projects.izzysoft.de/trac/imdbphp), but the methods to sort out the data (rating, runtime, director, etc.) are self written. Since the process of accessing every single IMDb page (one for each movie) takes quite some time, my script saves all information as well as the image in a cache folder.

The list can be accessed [here](src/movielist/movies.php).
