Several times within the last year, maybe two, I ventured into the depths of the interwebs in search of a monolingual Japanese dictionary app that could be used offline. What I found was JE-EJ dictionaries, 広辞苑第七版 for €89.99 and people in forums suggesting apps that wouldn't work offline. On my most recent desperate search I even came across a *geoblocked dictionary* app—to top it all off by a company deriving their name from the words "big" and "globe". m(

At this point I thought about just solving the problem myself. Looking at some dictionary websites, I found one where the entries were nicely enumerated from 1 to 297,199, so I wrote a small crawling script. In the meantime I used scholarly search engines to see if there happened to be some open data sets that could be used. I would've just thrown terms and definitions in an SQLite DB and installed some SQLite viewer on my phone.

In the end I found a better solution. One that's accessible and doesn't require technical skill—which is why I'm writing this. Watching [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-AfT8XW63w) (by [this guy](https://massimmersionapproach.com/about/)) I learned about [EPWING](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPWING), a JIS standardized [format](https://web.archive.org/web/20060106055719/http://www.epwing.or.jp/about/about.html) for digital dictionaries. Now, looking at aforementioned video you might get your hands on some such dictionaries. All you then need is an app to interface with them: I quickly found [DroidWing](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aokabi.android.droidwingfree), which I happily link here because the author also distributes a [paid version](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aokabi.android.droidwing) where the only difference is the icon color. <3

So yeah, not bound to any service provider, platform independent, offline ... 国語辞典 case solved for good. :3

(This is just to feed the Google, in case someone else also looks for a solution to this: アンドロイド アプリ 国語辞典 国語 辞典 辞書 オフライン 無料.)
