Four months in Japan; another review:

Turned out I [hit the breaks](/a/dcfa4ea5) early enough — no overload in terms of events. :)<br>
Lectures just started again after a short break around New Year, a friend visited for two weeks, and all in all things are good. :) I attend regular club meetings (<span class="mixlang"><span class="swap" swap="bukai"><span class="inner">部会</span></span></span>), get to know new people from time to time,  make new experiences ... oh and after living here for 4 months I *just* found out that at the public university (right next to the private one I actually go to — but I take lectures at the public one too) the canteen is opened on Saturdays. I missed out on 17 easy lunches since September just because it did not occur to me to check their canteen schedule.

In other news: the semester break is getting close. Not yet sure what I'll do in February. March is most likely to be spent travelling with JR's <span class="mixlang"><span class="swap" swap="Seishun 18 Ticket"><span class="inner">青春18きっぷ</span></span></span> (unless I find an even more cost efficient way). In any case:

On to the next month!
