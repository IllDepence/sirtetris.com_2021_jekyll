100 kanji, 285 words, 41 days. Finally gaining some speed again.

As always: [Anki stats](static/img/blog/anki_stats_140808.png) and [kanji so far](static/dl/kanji_checkpoint_11).

Correct answers on mature cards sub 90% today, which happens from time to time lately —　<span class="mixlang"><span class="swap" swap="concentrate, damnit!"><span class="inner">集中、集中！</span></span></span>

/edit: okay, if I [really focus](static/img/blog/anki_stats_140809.png) ... (the single one I got wrong was mixing up the meanings of <span class="mixlang"><span class="swap" swap="plan/estimate"><span class="inner">予定</span></span></span> and <span class="mixlang"><span class="swap" swap="assumption/hypothesis"><span class="inner">仮定</span></span></span>)
