100 kanji, 285 words, 41 days. Finally gaining some speed again.

As always: [Anki stats](static/img/blog/anki_stats_140808.png) and [kanji so far](static/dl/kanji_checkpoint_11).

Correct answers on mature cards sub 90% today, which happens from time to time lately —　<!-- mixlang:集中、集中！:concentrate, damnit! -->

/edit: okay, if I [really focus](static/img/blog/anki_stats_140809.png) ... (the single one I got wrong was mixing up the meanings of <!-- mixlang:予定:plan/estimate --> and <!-- mixlang:仮定:assumption/hypothesis -->)
