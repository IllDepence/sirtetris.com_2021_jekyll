Aaand again it's been one month and one day — during which I somehow pumped 98 kanji and 317 words into my brain.

Here's a screenshot of my [Anki stats](static/img/blog/anki_stats_140111.png) for the last 30 days.

Grammar: ["re rush"](http://moc.sirtetris.com/re_rush/) is completed and helped a lot, now I try to focus on free writing of continuous text instead of single example sentences and only take a look at new grammar topics every 4th day. Since I'm through Tae Kim's Grammar Guide completely I pick interesting topics on IMABI. Schedule: ["imabi_stroll"](http://moc.sirtetris.com/imabi_stroll/).

Misc: had a Skype conversation in Japanese in December which was a nice experience. But I definitely should speak more Japanese.

As always, for the sake of documentation, these are the [kanji I know so far](static/dl/kanji_checkpoint_6).
