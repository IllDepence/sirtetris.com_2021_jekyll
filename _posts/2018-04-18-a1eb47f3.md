Month six — two thrids done; one to go.

Going by the initial schedule this would've been my fifth day back in Germany. Glad I still have time to enjoy Japan now that it's finally not cold anymore. Maybe it'll be sick of the heat and humidity in July making it easier to go. ^_^    

As always, stuff happened:

* general
    * bought a <!-- mixlang:座椅子:Japanese chair with no legs -->
    * enjoyed a sunny Saturday in <!-- mixlang:隅田公園:Sumida Park -->, sitting on a stone wall reading a book, and saw three old ladies looking for somewhere to sit, so moved a bit to the side. Continuing my book I was handed a piece of <!-- mixlang:唐揚げ:fried chicken -->, two pieces of sushi and a some <!-- mixlang:和菓子:Japanese sweets --> — no small talk or questions, just <!-- mixlang:「はい。昼ご飯です。」:&quot;Here. That's your lunch.&quot; -->. :'D
    * started making my own <!-- mixlang:弁当:lunch boxes --> as a change to caffeteria food 
    * visited <!-- mixlang:かなまら祭り:the Kanamara festival --> which was great fun
    * was able to see some of the people that, through their videos, introduced me to Japan before I came here the first time over two years ago, irl at a YouTube hanami
    * lots of nice new people at the share house
    * had my first <!-- mixlang:馬刺し:basashi (raw, sliced horse meat) --> — tasty :)
* at the institute
    * started developing a piece of software that interacts with an application being developed by an external developer — both projects being in a prototype phase and the whole thing being orchestrated by my superviser. As a result I'm reading and writing *a lot* of Japanese e-mails — more <!-- mixlang:敬語:formal Japanese --> practice. orz

On to the next month!
