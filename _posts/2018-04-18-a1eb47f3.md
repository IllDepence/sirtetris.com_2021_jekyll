Month six — two thrids done; one to go.

Going by the initial schedule this would've been my fifth day back in Germany. Glad I still have time to enjoy Japan now that it's finally not cold anymore. Maybe it'll be sick of the heat and humidity in July making it easier to go. ^_^    

As always, stuff happened:

* general
    * bought a <span class="mixlang"><span class="swap" swap="Japanese chair with no legs"><span class="inner">座椅子</span></span></span>
    * enjoyed a sunny Saturday in <span class="mixlang"><span class="swap" swap="Sumida Park"><span class="inner">隅田公園</span></span></span>, sitting on a stone wall reading a book, and saw three old ladies looking for somewhere to sit, so moved a bit to the side. Continuing my book I was handed a piece of <span class="mixlang"><span class="swap" swap="fried chicken"><span class="inner">唐揚げ</span></span></span>, two pieces of sushi and a some <span class="mixlang"><span class="swap" swap="Japanese sweets"><span class="inner">和菓子</span></span></span> — no small talk or questions, just <span class="mixlang"><span class="swap" swap="&quot;Here. That's your lunch.&quot;"><span class="inner">「はい。昼ご飯です。」</span></span></span>. :'D
    * started making my own <span class="mixlang"><span class="swap" swap="lunch boxes"><span class="inner">弁当</span></span></span> as a change to caffeteria food 
    * visited <span class="mixlang"><span class="swap" swap="the Kanamara festival"><span class="inner">かなまら祭り</span></span></span> which was great fun
    * was able to see some of the people that, through their videos, introduced me to Japan before I came here the first time over two years ago, irl at a YouTube hanami
    * lots of nice new people at the share house
    * had my first <span class="mixlang"><span class="swap" swap="basashi (raw, sliced horse meat)"><span class="inner">馬刺し</span></span></span> — tasty :)
* at the institute
    * started developing a piece of software that interacts with an application being developed by an external developer — both projects being in a prototype phase and the whole thing being orchestrated by my superviser. As a result I'm reading and writing *a lot* of Japanese e-mails — more <span class="mixlang"><span class="swap" swap="formal Japanese"><span class="inner">敬語</span></span></span> practice. orz

On to the next month!
