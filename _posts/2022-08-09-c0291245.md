After two and a half years of not travelling I was able to make a two week trip to visit a research group at the National University of Singapore. :)

    * Home ⇄ airport: an annoyingly chaotic mess as is usual with DB (with a scary cherry on top in the form of a Lufthansa strike announcement which hit several flights on the day I was travelling but luckily not mine).
    * Airport ⇄ Singapore: smooth and without problems
