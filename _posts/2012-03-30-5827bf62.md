Added a "scrolling" fuctionality to the grid in the [photography section](/c/photography) â€” should now be at least a bit more comfortable to browse through. Writing it, however, wasn't that much of a pleasure. :D First of all things tend to end up pretty messy whenever I work on stuff "combining" PHP and JS. On top of that the "math" behind the shifting of my images went fully out of control. Loops and lists functioning in opposite directions, +1 here, -2 there &mdash; oh well ... somehow it's working now. :D
