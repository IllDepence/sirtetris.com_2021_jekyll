Six months in Japan; another review:

More or less a month ago I had my last exams for the winter semester; and the summer semester won't start until early April. What this means is that I have a lot of free time. :)

I've started to watch a lot of <span class="mixlang"><span class="swap" swap="non animated Japanese TV series"><span class="inner">ドラマ</span></span></span> and am currently in the midst of [previously mentioned](?a=80c729ee) train trip along Osaka, Nagoya, Tokyo, Kyoto. For accommodation I decided to give couchsurfing a try (except for one night in a capsule hotel). So far it's been great — but I get the feeling that a 10 day trip with 5 different hosts is on the edge between 'fun to meet new people' and 'kind of exhausting'. :D

After the trip I'm expecting to have some extensive downtime to recharge. ^_^'

On to the next month!
