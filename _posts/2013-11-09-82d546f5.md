Soo ... 37 days, 104 kanji and 291 words later:

Not much to say about kanji learning itself. One thing would be, that due to an [Anki update](http://ankisrs.net/docs/changes.html#changes-in-2.0.13) that changed the handling of sibling cards my second daily Anki session now includes a bit more cards than before and the first session a bit less. Not much of a change.  
I still try to keep the number of reviews due on one day between 80 and 100 but ... as my [Anki stats](static/img/blog/anki_stats_131109.png) reveal, not always manage to do that.

Since there's nothing more to say about kanji learning, a quick note on grammar:  
As opposed to vocab, grammar isn't super easily quantified. No numbers, no charts ... Because of that I had a little bit of a problem to continue practicing and learning new grammar for a while.  
To deal with that I stated a ["grammar rush"](http://moc.sirtetris.com/grammar_rush/) (inspired by [this YesJapan video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-9H_vAx8-I#t=6m57s)). Instead of really just flipping through a workbook and taking notes I read one chapter of [Tae Kim's Grammar Guide](http://www.guidetojapanese.org/learn/grammar) a day and post some example sentences using the new grammar on Lang-8. So far this works really well for me.

As always, for the sake of documentation, these are the [kanji I know so far](static/dl/kanji_checkpoint_4).
