@[300+](/a/579f082e) “I highly doubt I’ll reach 400+ in another four months.”

... well, make it two and a half then.

[103 kanji](/assets/dl/ro_kanji_checkpoint_4), 131 words, 79 days since [the last checkpoint](/a/579f082e).

The stupid Magicka power-up images are too tempting. I even created an additional one for a milestone that’s likely to come up within the next weeks or months. In any case—besides self-imposed rules and motivating milestones, this time <span class="mixlang"><span class="swap" swap="Chinese zodiacs"><span class="inner">干支</span></span></span> served as a source of a few more kanji, there’s food and cooking stuff like <span class="mixlang"><span class="swap" swap="ladle"><span class="inner">杓子</span></span></span>, <span class="mixlang"><span class="swap" swap="to roast"><span class="inner">炙る</span></span></span> and <span class="mixlang"><span class="swap" swap="hot sake"><span class="inner">燗酒</span></span></span>, as well as *still* a non-negligible amount of kanji in the “oh yeah I actually already know this” category, like <span class="mixlang"><span class="swap" swap="Coffee"><span class="inner">珈琲</span></span></span> and <span class="mixlang"><span class="swap" swap="Giraffe"><span class="inner">麒麟</span></span></span>.

This time I’m calling it though. No 500+ in the foreseeable future, *but* one more Magicka power-up flavored post so come soon. :)
