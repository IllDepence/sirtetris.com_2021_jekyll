I started taking beginner level Japanese courses at uni. The general path to learning the language and regular practice it provides seems to be exactly what was necessary to get me going. My learning efforts — til then not more than learning kana, remembering overused phrases from anime and then stagnating for like ... a year? I don't even know — suddenly skyrocketed and I now have to almost force myself to invest time into all the other stuff I have to do. You know ... my actual field of study and all that. ;P  
Anyway, Japanese, besides being listed as one of my interests, is now also a [project](/projects). And btw.: [Lang-8](http://lang-8.com/) is awesome!
