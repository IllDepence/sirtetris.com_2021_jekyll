Got some stuff that I could have mentioned ... so: combo post!

#### CLI Love
I took some time to test some alternatives to the software I use on a daily basis. I dropped the window manager [awesome](http://awesome.naquadah.org/) for [spectrwm](https://opensource.conformal.com/wiki/spectrwm) — a lot less crappy configuration, even more minimalistic and quite another approach to multi screen handling (still have to fully get used to it, but seems usable).  
Furthermore I switched from [PCManFM](http://wiki.lxde.org/en/PCManFM) to [ranger](http://ranger.nongnu.org/) ♥ and finally moved on from [VLC media player](http://www.videolan.org/) to [mpd](http://mpd.wikia.com/) + [ncmpc](http://freecode.com/projects/ncmpc) for music and [SMPlayer](http://smplayer.sourceforge.net/) for video matters.

#### Speedcubing
I attended a speedcubing competition ... just for fun. Now I have this fancy page with official results at the [World Cube Association](http://www.worldcubeassociation.org/results/p.php?i=2013SAIE02). I'm pretty happy with the results as my times really are that inconsistent and I got rather nervous when it got official. I can do sub 30s, but that's only lucky exceptions.

#### Half-Life
I wondered how long it would take me to play through Half-Life, so I gave it a shot:

#### .XCompose kana input
I extended my [.XCompose](https://raw.github.com/IllDepence/dotfiles/master/XCompose) file to now also support katakana instead of hiragana only and added some punctuation that was still missing.

#### Poral chibi portrait
Alisa created this awesome Portal themed chibi portrait of me that's now accompanying this blog post. :3 Here's her [website](http://sakubik.com/) — read the "very soon" in a vaporware-ish "when it's done" kind of way. :D
