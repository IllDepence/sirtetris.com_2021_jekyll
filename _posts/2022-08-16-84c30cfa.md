Following up the two weeks [in Singapore](/a/c0291245) with two months in Japan. :)

As with Singapore, the trip is for a research collaboration but I’ll mostly focus on the things aside from research here. This post will cover everything up until I entered Japan.

**Applying for travel grants**  
About half a year after I started my PhD COVID-19 hit. Not happy with the thought of finishing it without any international experience, I always kept an eye on possibilities should travel become possible again. In late 2021 I started preparation for the [JSPS Summer Program](https://www.jsps.go.jp/english/e-summer/). Made out eight Japanese labs in the NLP area and ended up “cold e-mailing” four. Result: 1 ignore, 1 reject, and 2 positive replies. Decided on one, set up a research plan with together them, applied ... and got rejected.

Luckily I had access to a university internal funding program here that would allow for an arrangement similar to the JSPS Summer Program in terms of timing, length, and funding. So, re-cycled the research plan, adjusted everything to the different application forms and requirements, applied again ... and was accepted. :)

**VISA and COVID stuff**
