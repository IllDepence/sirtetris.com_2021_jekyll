One year in Japan; a last review:

My last month in Japan began during a trip to Tokyo. I couchsurfed again and had 3 awesome hosts over 8 days. I went to Ueno park several times because of the ridiculous [Pokemon Go situtaion](/assets/img/blog/myj15_add18.jpg), climed [Mt. Fuji](/assets/img/blog/myj15_add20.jpg) ([great view from the top](/assets/img/blog/myj15_add22.jpg), also a [gym at station 9](/assets/img/blog/myj15_add21.jpg)), hung around with two [Taiwanese friends](/assets/img/blog/myj15_add19.jpg), went to [Enoshima](/assets/img/blog/myj15_add23.jpg) and attended [Comiket](/assets/img/blog/myj15_add24.jpg).  
The last 3 weeks I lived in a share house, did some translation/localization work as an alternative to paying rent and continued the series of farewell events and meetups. I also finally got my JLPT N2 result. Passed with a score of 140/180. :)

Looking back at the year as a whole: *very* much worth it. Set out to improve my Japanese, did just that and made a bunch of good memories. As for Japan, the pros (respectful people, safe, fascinating contemporary and ancient culture, no tipping, ...) outweigh the cons (vacuous positivity, non-existent insulation of buildings, overdone collectivism, pricy, ...) for me. I'll definitely go again some time.

On to the ... oh wait. :(
