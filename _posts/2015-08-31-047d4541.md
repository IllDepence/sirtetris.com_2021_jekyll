Three to four years ago I gradually developed an interest in Japanese culture. Two and a half years ago I [started](/a/72ecfbb4) [learning Japanese](?t=japanese). One year ago I got in touch with the [University of Freiburg](https://www.uni-freiburg.de/) regarding the possibility of studying abroad in Japan. Now, after two semesters in Freiburg, I'm about to start a year at [<span class="mixlang"><span class="swap" swap="Matsuyama University"><span class="inner">松山大学</span></span></span>](https://www.matsuyama-u.ac.jp/) as an exchange student.

I've never lived or studied [outside of Baden-Württemberg](/assets/img/blog/edu.webm), so I'm really excited about how such an amount of change will affect me. I'm also super hyped that I will finally be able to invest pretty much [ALL MY TIME](/assets/img/blog/jp_timeline.png) into improving my language skills. So far I always had to fit language learning somewhere inbetween while my bachelor's or master's degree were the quasi obligatory main thing.

Preparations are as good as done. Journey starts Sep 8<sup>th</sup>. Updates will be tagged [#MYJ15](/s/MYJ15). :)
