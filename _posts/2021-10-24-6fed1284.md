In 2016 I [stumbled upon](/a/d932debd) <span class="mixlang"><span class="swap" swap="Ubunchu!"><span class="inner">うぶんちゅ！</span></span></span>, a Creative Commons licensed manga about Ubuntu, published between 2008 and 2013. Over the years I've been [translating](https://sirtetris.gitlab.io/ubunchu-translation/) chapters 9 and onwards at a snail’s pace of one chapter per year. This year, I thought I’d complete the series with chapter 14.

For translating chapter 14 I wanted to find out the intended reading of <span class="mixlang"><span class="swap" swap="Ichinomiya (?)"><span class="inner">壱宮</span></span></span>—the school in which the story takes place. Spelled out in full, <span class="mixlang"><span class="swap" swap="Ichinomiya (?) Prefectural Highschool"><span class="inner">県立壱宮高校</span></span></span>, the school was only mentioned on the author’s website until [late 2015](https://web.archive.org/web/20151011180602/http://www.aerialline.com/comics/ubunchu), but with no indication of its reading.

Searching around I found that the French Wikipedia had [an article](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubunchu!) on the manga. While it doesn’t contain a hint to the school’s name, I noticed it lists a *fifteenth* chapter titled <span class="mixlang"><span class="swap" swap="Did you see Ubuntu Touch!?"><span class="inner">Ubuntu Touchは見た!?</span></span></span>. I was only aware of 14! Searching the web for the chapter’s title I found ... nothing. The only Google hit is the French Wikipedia article itself, nothing on archive.org, and [the edit](https://fr.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ubunchu!&diff=178647277&oldid=178552252) adding the info to Wikipedia is by a user with no contact information. Why Titan2016, why?!

All the chapters I knew of at that point are freely available online. [Chapters 1–11](http://www.aerialline.com/comics/ubunchu/) on the author’s page—even including PSD source files—, and chapters [12](https://web.archive.org/web/20151224113446/http://ubuntu.asciimw.jp/elem/000/000/010/10503/public-pdf/UM08_P53-68.pdf), [13](https://web.archive.org/web/20151224174413/http://ubuntu.asciimw.jp/elem/000/000/010/10533/UM09_P49-P64.pdf), and [14](https://web.archive.org/web/20151224113340/http://ubuntu.asciimw.jp/elem/000/000/010/10558/UM10_P51-66.pdf) on the page of Ubuntu Magazine Japan—albeit only though archive.org because [the site closed in 2017](https://web.archive.org/web/20211023104613/http://ubuntu.asciimw.jp/).

I carefully searched the Ubuntu Magazine Japan page for any traces of the ominous chapter 15. For all issues, when released online, there’d be a blog post with a table of contents ([example](https://web.archive.org/web/20160326034112/http://ubuntu.asciimw.jp/elem/000/000/010/10558/)). Volume 10 including <span class="mixlang"><span class="swap" swap="Ubunchu!"><span class="inner">うぶんちゅ！</span></span></span> chapter 14 being the last of them [at the very top of the page](https://web.archive.org/web/20160326085300/http://ubuntu.asciimw.jp/cate/5001/) didn’t give me much hope. Besides issues 1–10, the page mentions a [“2013 Summer issue”](https://web.archive.org/web/20150402043922/http://ubuntu.asciimw.jp/elem/000/000/010/10549/), but on the [cover](/assets/img/blog/finding_ubunchu_15_cover.jpg) there’s no mention of <span class="mixlang"><span class="swap" swap="Ubunchu!"><span class="inner">うぶんちゅ！</span></span></span>, and the description only names some of the contents plus a vague <span class="mixlang"><span class="swap" swap="also contains our usual contents"><span class="inner">いつもの連載も掲載しています</span></span></span>.

Following the “2013 Summer issue” lead though I found [this blog post](https://naruoga.hatenablog.com/entry/20130608/1370649262) stating about the issue “[Story about Ubuntu Touch]. <span class="mixlang"><span class="swap" swap="And it’s also featured in Ubunchu!"><span class="inner">「うぶんちゅ！」でも取り上げられてますしね</span></span></span>.” A few clicks later I found the issue [on BOOK☆WALKER](https://bookwalker.jp/de25473cc5-4d0a-4223-88f8-2a2ac86e0182/) which has a preview of not only the cover but also the first few pages and lo and behold ... [THERE IT IS](/assets/img/blog/finding_ubunchu_15_preview.jpg)! Add to cart, proceed to check out, [LET’S GO!](/assets/img/blog/finding_ubunchu_15_checkout.jpg)

So yeah, Titan2016 turned out to be a trustworthy source. ^\_^ Ubunchu chapter 15, うぶんちゅ！ 第15回 Ubuntu Touchは見た!? exists and [can be bought here](https://bookwalker.jp/de25473cc5-4d0a-4223-88f8-2a2ac86e0182/). Which also means I’ll put out one more translation next year. Keep a lookout for it [here](https://sirtetris.gitlab.io/ubunchu-translation/).
