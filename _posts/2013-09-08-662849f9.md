Strange thing about Amazon: Japanese books (offered on amazon.com and amazon.de) are [not available for the standard Kindle](static/img/blog/jp_kindle_0.jpg) although it's perfectly capable of displaying Japanese content. This applies to *all* books in Japanese. Which sucks. So contacted support concerning that matter ...

Fortunately there are alternatives: [青空文庫 (Aozora Bunko)](http://www.aozora.gr.jp/) offers Japanese books for free and with [青空キンドル (Aozora Kindle)](http://a2k.aill.org/) you can easily convert them to beautiful PDFs. :)  
To do that, take a book from 青空文庫 (for example [this](http://www.aozora.gr.jp/cards/000311/card2762.html)), scroll down to the ファイルのダウンロード section and copy the URL to the zip file. In our example that's: `http://www.aozora.gr.jp/cards/000311/files/2762_ruby_8768.zip`. Head to 青空キンドル, paste the URL, change settings if you want (I recommend setting the 文字 to 大), hit PDF化, copy the PDF file to your Kindle and you're done. :)  
Beautiful [Japanese](static/img/blog/jp_kindle_1.jpg) on your [Kindle](static/img/blog/jp_kindle_2.jpg). What you may want to avoid, however, is using Japanese file names. They [won't be displayed as expected](static/img/blog/jp_kindle_3.jpg), which I presume it's due to the FAT 32 file system.
