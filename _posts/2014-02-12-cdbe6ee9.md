100 kanji and 270 words, again in one month and one day — we'll see how that develops once I start writing my thesis in March. :D

Anyway: [Anki stats](static/img/blog/anki_stats_140212.png) for the last 30 days, [imabi_stroll](http://moc.sirtetris.com/imabi_stroll/) is still going although I got a bit lazy and missed a lot of days.

A new thing I gave shot is [reading manga](https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/100379889147661298516) collaboratively (taking turns) in hangouts. It's really fun but the events are at 4 AM for me (GMT+1), which is pretty awful. D: But I will try to continue attending from time to time.

As always, for the sake of documentation, these are the [kanji I know so far](static/dl/kanji_checkpoint_7).
