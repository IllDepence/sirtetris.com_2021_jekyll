[99 kanji](/assets/dl/ro_kanji_checkpoint_3), 119 words, 112 days since [the last checkpoint](/a/579b082d).

And again, round about the same time span. I highly doubt I’ll reach 400+ in another four months, though. This time—especially towards the end—felt like I was pushing the limits of what I currently feel makes sense to put on flashcards and actively study. Maybe if I start putting names and their most common readings into the mix?
Or <span class="mixlang"><span class="swap" swap="old kanji forms"><span class="inner">旧字体</span></span></span> like <span class="mixlang"><span class="swap" swap="学"><span class="inner">學</span></span></span>, <span class="mixlang"><span class="swap" swap="国"><span class="inner">國</span></span></span>, etc.? We’ll see. In any case, currently being at a combined 2,444 considering both recognition only and recognition+recall, I’ll definitely find some way to justify another 56 across the two decks. ^\_^  
Vocabulary sources this time were mostly books, but I still had a surprising amount of “oh yeah I actually already know this” moments. For example <span class="mixlang"><span class="swap" swap="strawberry"><span class="inner">苺</span></span></span>, <span class="mixlang"><span class="swap" swap="trap"><span class="inner">罠</span></span></span>, and <span class="mixlang"><span class="swap" swap="kite"><span class="inner">凧</span></span></span>.  
Key observation this time: the stupid Magicka power-up images I stitched together for this series are annoyingly motivating. I really want to post the 400+ one but I’m not sure if I’ll get there without creating a bunch of Anki cards that aren’t of much actual use. ^\_^'
