@[2100+](70125fa1) *“Another possibility I see, is that at some point I deviate from my current procedure of learning to read **and write** every kanji and create a separate **recognition only** deck.”*

... which is what I ended up doing in late January this year. So here’s the first checkpoint for recognition only kanji.

[102 kanji](/assets/dl/ro_kanji_checkpoint_1), 95 words, 124 days<sup>(since the creation of the recognition only deck)</sup>

In part I add stuff I already know, whenever it comes to my mind. Like <span class="mixlang"><span class="swap" swap="fight"><span class="inner">喧嘩</span></span></span>, <span class="mixlang"><span class="swap" swap="kitchen"><span class="inner">厨房</span></span></span>, and <span class="mixlang"><span class="swap" swap="rose"><span class="inner">薔薇</span></span></span>. But the bulk of the first 100 are from words I picked up while reading books—lots from <span class="mixlang"><span class="swap" swap="can’t quit simultaneous interpretation"><span class="inner">同時通訳はやめられない</span></span></span>, like <span class="mixlang"><span class="swap" swap="frown"><span class="inner">顰蹙</span></span></span>, <span class="mixlang"><span class="swap" swap="the true charm"><span class="inner">醍醐味</span></span></span>, and <span class="mixlang"><span class="swap" swap="exhaustion"><span class="inner">憔悴</span></span></span>.

Observations from using a recognition only deck so far:

* I think I got more vigilant with actually looking up words I can’t read that I come across, instead of just deducing blanks from context.
* Awareness of kanji (components’) <span class="mixlang"><span class="swap" swap="readings used in kanji compounds"><span class="inner">音読み</span></span></span> is bliss. I feel like I usually go from kanji parts to reading to meaning. For example, reading <span class="mixlang"><span class="swap" swap="intimidation (‘dōkatsu’)"><span class="inner">恫喝</span></span></span> I spot <span class="mixlang"><span class="swap" swap="pronounced ‘dō’"><span class="inner">同</span></span></span> and the right part of <span class="mixlang"><span class="swap" swap="pronounced ‘katsu’"><span class="inner">渇</span></span></span><sup>1</sup>, at which point I know <span class="mixlang"><span class="swap" swap="‘dōkatsu’"><span class="inner">どうかつ</span></span></span> which then leads me to the meaning.  
  <small><sup>1)</sup> I’m aware of <span class="mixlang"><span class="swap" swap="also pronounced ‘katsu’"><span class="inner">曷</span></span></span> which would also help w/ e.g. <span class="mixlang"><span class="swap" swap="conflict (‘kattō’)"><span class="inner">葛藤</span></span></span> but my brain always recalls the 渇 from <span class="mixlang"><span class="swap" swap="water shortage (‘kassui’)"><span class="inner">渇水</span></span></span></small>.
* I still haven’t tackled names yet. I’m considering to just add some cards for the most common readings of the most common names and maybe some well known people.

So yeah ... multi <s>track drifting</s> deck kanji’ing. I’d be surprised if there weren’t more updates to come in the future.
