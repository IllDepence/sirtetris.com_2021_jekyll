100 kanji, 733 words, 1020 days<sup>1</sup>; [Anki stats](static/img/blog/anki_stats_190928.jpg), [kanji so far](static/dl/kanji_checkpoint_21).  
<small><sup>1)</sup> Since [the last time](?a=1f099c17) I wrote one of these.</small>

@[100+](?a=e61bc488) “*there will — hopefully — be a total of 21 of these in the end*”  
 ✔ done  
@[2000+](?a=1f099c17) “*I'm really not sure I'll ever get to 2100*”  
 only took close to 3 years ^_^'

As a comparison to the 1020 days this time, I took me 1301 days from 0 to 2000. Given I stopped to actively search for new kanji to learn just for the sake of it at [1800](?a=bd733663), [extrapolation shenanigans](static/img/blog/kanji_predict_2200.png) ([code](https://gist.github.com/IllDepence/372057289bfbe6e8c1e49056f22f965a)) put reaching 2200 somewhere between September 16, 2023 and August 10, 2024.

Largest contributors to the 100 new kanji that seemed worth remembering were <span class="mixlang"><span class="swap" swap="Japan Kanji Aptitude Test"><span class="inner">漢検</span></span></span> preparation and books. Depending on how my reading habits and <span class="mixlang"><span class="swap" swap="Japan Kanji Aptitude Test"><span class="inner">漢検</span></span></span> aspirations develop I wouldn't be surprised to end up writing a *2200+* entry at some point. Another possibility I see, is that at some point I deviate from my current procedure of learning to read *and write* every kanji and create a separate *recognition only* deck. Maybe for names that would make sense? I don't know yet. Natural exposure might be enough for that. Time will tell.
