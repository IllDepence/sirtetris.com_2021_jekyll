* Singapore (GMT+8) → Germany (GMT+2) → Japan (GMT+9)
    * → bed at ~16:00, wake up at 0:00~2:00, ... live on +6
* realization: want to by food for breakfast but stores are not open
* constantly converting in my head between "my time" and "other people time"/"real time"
* re-booked train to FRA and PCR test
* realized that FRA hotel breakfast will be my lunch
