A few weeks ago I thought it would be nice to try out time-lapse photography. I searched for ways to trigger my DSLR in given inverals and found, that the plug for wired remotes was some proprietary Nikon thing and timer remotes cost 40€ upwards.

Fortunately, DSLRs can also be triggered using an infrared signal. I already owned an Nikon ML-L3, a normal IR remote compatible to my Nikon D80. So what I did (and what you can also do to have fun with IR devices) was [**this**](static/img/blog/irremote_tldr.jpg).

Simply connect an IR LED to an audio cable and use it to record and send IR signals. It's that easy. : )
