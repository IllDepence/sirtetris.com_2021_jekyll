About a year ago I [came back to Germany](?a=17d61d5b) after spending [one year in Japan](?t=MYJ15). Now I'm going again — for six months. :)

Last time I went as an exchange student. This time I got into an internship program for Ph.D. and Master students at the [National Institute of Informatics](http://nii.ac.jp/). — i.e. this time I'm actually doing something related to my studies <sup style="font-size: 0.5em;">(my exchange university last time had no computer science courses)</sup>.

Another major difference is that this time I had to organize accommodation by myself. Find a place to live in Tokyo — what a nice ex ante adventure, yay ᕕ( ᐛ )ᕗ. What I knew from the beginning is that I would search for a room in a share house. I had previously made good experiences with share houses in Japan, knew that it would be cheaper, save me the hassle of having to buy a gazillion every day life items for just half a year and get rid of them afterwards, and knowing that I might end up speaking primarily English at work, a share house with Japanese people would up my chances of having extended conversations in Japanese on a daily basis.  
So, I started searching on [roomshare.jp](http://roomshare.jp/) and [roommate.jp](http://roommate.jp/), took a brief glimpse at non-shared flats on [<!-- mixlang:グッドマンスリー:Guddomansurii -->](http://www.good-monthly.com/) only to be scared away by the prices, and finally found something at [<!-- mixlang:ひつじ不動産:Hitsujifudōsan -->](https://www.hituji.jp/). Given what I wanted — something not too far from work, not too expensive, where I could let someone stay at my place for a night or two, where thery're okay with someone who's guaranteed to leave after 6 months and on top of all that where a foreigner is able to sign a contract without a Japanese guarantor — I'm *super* happy with the place I found. :)  
Additionally the countless mails back and forth until I found the place, the deal was sealed and all the details were discussed were *quite* the <!-- mixlang:敬語:Keigo (polite language) --> boot camp. orz

Anyway, preparations are as good as done. Journey starts Oct 17<sup>th</sup>. Updates will be tagged [#NII17](?t=NII17). :)
