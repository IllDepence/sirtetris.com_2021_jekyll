After [Japan](/s/JAmonthly) and [Singapore](/a/c0291245), Taiwan is now the third Asian country I visited — albeit only for a few days. It’s always been on my bucket list of travel destinations. What set things in motion now was a co-worker telling me about [2025 開源人年會](https://coscup.org/2025) / [COSCUP 2025](https://coscup.org/2025/en/).

The event was packet with talks right up my alley like

* [Open Source for Open Science](https://coscup.org/2025/en/sessions/TW83J9)
* [Wikidata: Wikimedia's knowledge graph in a world of generative AI](https://coscup.org/2025/en/sessions/MFYLCR)
* [The Status of Sinitic Languages and Formosan Languages in MediaWiki](https://coscup.org/2025/en/sessions/U7BPKB)

... and I’m sure if I understood Mandarin I would’ve had an even harder time to choose which talks to listen to. Among the booths, I especially was happy to see and have a chat with the folks from [Framework](https://frame.work/). All in all people were great, content was great, and since the event was held on a University campus I felt right at home. ^\_^

In terms of Taiwan/Taipei in general:

Food

* Love the [breakfast](/assets/img/blog/salty_soy_milk.jpg) culture — especially <span class="mixlang"><span class="swap" swap="the “Salty” Soy Milk"><span class="inner">鹹豆漿</span></span></span>.
* Love the fact there’s tonns of buffet style food places with tons of veggies (search for 素食 and 自助餐 to find them).
* The night markets don’t really align with my sleep cycle and eating habits, but I went once and enjoyed some “fried milk”, sweet potato balls, and a peanut ice cream roll.

Language

* I like “小心” (characters for small and heart), on [signs calling for attention](/assets/img/blog/watch_your_step_taiwan.jpg) like “watch your step”.
* Found the [localization of the Kinder Chocolate logo](/assets/img/blog/kinder_loangraph.jpg) interesting. Where the original Roman alphabet rendition has six letters with the first in black and the remaining five in red, the [loangraph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_character_classification#Loangraphs) rendition “健達” only has two characters. To avoid having half of the [word mark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wordmark) in black, the color change is only applied to the radical of the first character — the “亻” of “健”.
* In some places I found Japanese to be understood more readily than English.

Misc

* Was able to [try out](/assets/img/blog/tex_keyboards.jpg) several [TEX keyboards](https://tex.com.tw/) at an [INPAD](https://www.inpad.com.tw/) store.
* The [Taipei 101 tuned mass damper](/assets/img/blog/taipei_101_tuned_mass_damper.jpg) was cool.
* Realized that you have to hail busses just like in [Singapore](/a/c0291245). Successfully did so on day three.
* Japan specific rather than about Taiwan, but: the trip was the first time I left Japan temporarily. Both of my previous long term stays in Japan were beginning to end, such that leaving Japan also meant having my <span class="mixlang"><span class="swap" swap="resident card"><span class="inner">在留カード</span></span></span> invalidated. This time I made use of the [みなし再入国許可](https://www.moj.go.jp/isa/immigration/procedures/minashisainyukoku_00001.html) system. You fill out a <span class="mixlang"><span class="swap" swap="embarkation card for reentrant"><span class="inner">再入国出国記録</span></span></span> and hand it to the immigration officer when leaving the country. Easy enough. When entering Japan again, there’s a special route for re-entry. Funnily enough, paths are first divided into “Japanese national” and “visitor” and then *within the “visitor” path* it branches off to “re-entry”. — I’m not a visitor I live here (ó﹏ò｡)

Hope to see you and enjoy your awesome breakfasts again, Taiwan. 謝謝!
