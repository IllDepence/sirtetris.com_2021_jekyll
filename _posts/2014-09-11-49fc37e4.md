98 kanji, 301 words, 34 days; [Anki stats](/assets/img/blog/anki_stats_140911.png), [kanji so far](/assets/dl/kanji_checkpoint_12).

Close to 100/30 and a nice word/kanji ratio — I'm fine with that. Maybe I'll get to 1300 before Oct 13th, which is when my master's starts. In any case I'll have to deal with moving and stuff before that. Hopefully that won't slow me down a lot. We'll see. :)
