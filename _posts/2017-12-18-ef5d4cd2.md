Month two of only six this time; another review:

I did better with Anki this month ([stats](static/img/blog/anki_stats_171218.png)); even managed to stoll through <!-- mixlang:神保町:Jinbōchō -->, grab a second hand book ([<!-- mixlang:日本語雑記帳:nihongozakkichō -->](https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/4004313511)) and read from time to time. Still ... my deck needs some maintenance, I want to add more new vocab, read more, etc. I took part in events, explored new places and worked a bit on personal projects. Still ... I feel I could do more. Maybe being aware that there's *soo* much going on around me constantly, resutls in a fear of missing out on great chances. But it's not just that. Regardless of the specifics of what's going on around me, I'd like to do more — more than I currently can do with the limited amount of productive time per day. On the bright side, that's a least better than not knowing what to do with myself.

Again, a collection of noteworthy and/or random things:  

* general
    * the <!-- mixlang:漢字ミュージアム:kanji museum --> in Kyōto [is nice](static/img/blog/kanji_museum.jpg) — you can do mini <!-- mixlang:漢検:kanji aptitude test --> samples<br>(I seem to be able to pass <!-- mixlang:6級:level 6 (goes from 10 easiest to 1 impossible) --> and 5級, but 4級 and 3級 were so so)
    * [<!-- mixlang:ゲームマーケット2017秋:Game Market 2017 Autumn -->](static/img/blog/game_market.jpg) had a real life Catan trading and in general was super fun
    * [Agricola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agricola_(board_game)) seems to be popular among board game enthusiasts here<br>(a local meetup I attended was almost exclusively Agricola, played one round)
    * at <!-- mixlang:ポタフェス2017:Portable Audio Festival 2017 --> I was able to experience the [Sennheiser HE 1](http://sennheiser.com/sennheiser-he-1)<br>(kind of ... didn't have the time to really choose music, was in a noisy environment, etc.)
    * [Open Space 2017](http://www.ntticc.or.jp/en/exhibitions/2017/open-space-2017-re-envisioning-the-future/) at the NTT ICC [was good fun](static/img/blog/open_space.jpg)
    * [CJK Unicode shenanigans](https://github.com/IllDepence/goyoukumimoji)
* at the institute
    * wrote a small flask web application that is now used in production, hosted by the NII
    * the elevators don't say <!-- mixlang:「本日はご苦労様でした」:&quot;Thank you for your hard work today&quot; --> when you get out way after 5 p.m.
    * the elevators say <!-- mixlang:「おはようございます」:&quot;Good morning&quot; --> at 8:50 a.m. — need further data to estimate a time frame for that
    * attended [NTCIR 13](http://research.nii.ac.jp/ntcir/ntcir-13/) sporadically; chatted with some Yahoo! guys

All in all, a lot of good stuff. But MOAR WANT. TOO MUCH WANT.

On to the next month!
