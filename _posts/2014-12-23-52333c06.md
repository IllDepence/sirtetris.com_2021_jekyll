99 kanji, 240 words, 33 days; [Anki stats](/assets/img/blog/anki_stats_141223.png)<sup>[1]</sup>, [kanji so far](/assets/dl/kanji_checkpoint_15).

Exactly hit the 3 kanji/day average this time. In other words: almost keeping pace. :)

Tandem is still great. Furthermore I have to say that socializing with the local community of Japanese and Japanese learners turned out to be super beneficial on several occasions — apart from the obvious benefit of getting to know interesting people and having a good time. Networking is the buzzword to apply here I guess.
