Whenever I wanted to terminate a program by force I used `ps -A | grep PROGNAME`, read the process id and then executed `sudo kill PID`. Now I wrote a one line bash script making things easier â€” reducing the required effort by half:

    #!/bin/bash
    sudo kill `ps -A | grep $1 | grep -Eo '[0-9]{3,4}'`

Also usable as a one line command which requires one to enter the program's name afterwards:

    read x;sudo kill `ps -A | grep $x | grep -Eo '[0-9]{3,4}'`

The first version, however, is much more convenient. I stored it as `nkill` in `/usr/bin/` which enables me to for example kill firefox with `nkill firefox` or kill all open terminals with `nkill xterm`.

**Update:** Uhm ... yeah ... I just learned that pkill does *just that*. :D
