I've been playing around with Google+ for three days now. Aside from the fact, that Google+ is made by Google, which is reason enough to join, I have to say I really like it. Yes it is [quite simmilar to Facebook](http://xkcd.com/918), but hey: it's a social network and at the moment Facebook is by far the most successful one. If Google+ wasn't quite like Facebook it had to be ... revolutionary — which it is not. But it definitely is woth trying out and as soon as the integration of other Google services is pushed forward, the answer to the question *"Which social network should I use?"* is, not only based on image but also based on functionality, **Google+**.

Interesting stuff: [Inside Google Plus](http://insidegoogleplus.de) (a German blog) and [Google+ Tips and Tricks](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cUjZ_7rlAmKRDVB6GXId73h_eUdXGKdjtSff0svbaz0/preview?hl=de&pli=1&sle=true) (a collaborative document).
