After having been to Japan as [an exchange student](/s/MYJ15), [a research intern](/s/NII17), [a tou](/a/f29d4d64)[rist](/a/87696676), and [a visiting PhD student](/s/UTYO22), I’m adding another type of visa and status of residence to the list. This time, it will be a work visa — specifically, a [highly skilled professional visa](https://www.mofa.go.jp/j_info/visit/visa/long/visa16.html) (HSP). Below, I’ll write about the job hunting process, visa acquisition, and preparations for moving.

**🔍 Job hunting from abroad** — fresh master’s graduate  
In early 2019, I had my first experience with hunting for a job in Japan from abroad. The plan back then was to line up a job for when I’d finish my master’s. Going by old notes, I could reconstruct the following.

* Material
    * [Japanese “fill-in form” CV](https://github.com/shigio/rireki-style)
    * [Online CV](https://github.com/pages-themes/minimal)
* Searched on
    * [indeed](https://jp.indeed.com/)
    * [Wantedly](https://jp.wantedly.com/)
    * [Daijob](https://www.daijob.com/)
* Application process
    * 7 job openings I applied for
    * 2 companies I had interviews with <!-- included 職務適正検査 and 課題 -->
    * 1 job offer

The jobs I applied for were in software engineering (NLP, web, etc.), data science, and system administration. The offer I got was for a web development position. In the end though, I also got offered a PhD position in Germany on short notice, which I ended up taking.

**🔍 Job hunting from abroad** — PhD with some job experience  
Doing a PhD wasn’t among the “career path” options I had put much consideration into. Because of that, taking the unexpected offer in 2019 didn’t mean to me calling off Japan, but simply putting the move on hold for a bit. Accordingly, I reinitiated the job hunt as the PhD finish line slowly but surely came into view in 2023. Similar to my job hunt in 2019, I primarily searched for industry jobs (rather than a postdoc position). Different from last time, because I had a good four years of full-time employment as a research associate on my CV, I targeted <span class="mixlang"><span class="swap" swap="mid-career recruitment"><span class="inner">中途採用</span></span></span> rather than <span class="mixlang"><span class="swap" swap="new graduate recruitment"><span class="inner">新卒採用</span></span></span>.

As for a rough timeline, about a year before my estimated finishing date, I updated my English LinkedIn profile, set it to “open for work”, and started to occasionally browse [TokyoDev](https://www.tokyodev.com/) to get a first feeling for sought out skills, typical work conditions, etc. During this phase, I got contacted by one bilingual recruiter on LinkedIn and had some helpful discussions. However, since it still was quite some time until I’d be available to start a job, we didn’t get into any application processes.

After about half a year of “passive mode” I switched gears into actively preparing and applying. First things first, I translated my [CV](https://github.com/barraq/pandoc-moderncv) to Japanese — no typical “fill-in form” CV though; kind of felt like a thing for fresh graduates. Second, I looked into search strategies (job platforms, search terms, etc.). Below is a list of the materials I prepared and search paths I took.

* Material
    * [Web + print CV](https://github.com/barraq/pandoc-moderncv)
    * Profiles on job platforms*
* Searched on
    * [TokyoDev](https://www.tokyodev.com/)
    * [japandev](https://japan-dev.com/)
    * LinkedIn*
    * [Green](https://www.green-japan.com/)*
    * [CareerCross](https://www.careercross.com/)*
    * [JREC-IN](https://jrecin.jst.go.jp/)*
    * The Web
    * Company websites
        * German companies (Siemens, Bosch, Volkswagen, etc.)
        * Sponsors of the [Open Source Summit Japan](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/open-source-summit-japan/) (Fujitsu, NEC, NTT Data, etc.) <!-- http://web.archive.org/web/20231130075451/https://events.linuxfoundation.org/open-source-summit-japan/#post-185989 -->

The platform I ended up using the most is [Green](https://www.green-japan.com/). In addition to a messaging system from being “scouted” by recruiters or companies, they also allow companies to “like” your profile, based on which you can accept to have a talk. Additionally, they endorse having a <span class="mixlang"><span class="swap" swap="casual talk"><span class="inner">カジュアル面談</span></span></span> as a first step, to ensure a basic mutual understanding. In my experience, <span class="mixlang"><span class="swap" swap="casual talks"><span class="inner">カジュアル面談</span></span></span> are great, but scout messages and likes, while giving a nice confidence boost, are a bit of a mixed bag. Companies and recruiters on Green seem to message and like a bit excessively, which is why I would suggest preparing a template message to check your key conditions with the other side. In my case, even though I clearly stated in my profile that I require visa sponsorship and exclusively search for full-remote jobs, a considerable portion of people that contacted me turned out to not be able to accommodate for that, once I checked with them. So, first shoot back with a template message, and only *after* confirmation that key conditions are met invest time into properly engaging.

Another peculiarity of Green is their podcast, [グリテンラジオ](https://www.green-japan.com/contents/guriten_radio) ([YT](https://www.youtube.com/@guriten_radio)), which was a nice companion for the journey. To give a few example of the contents they discuss:

* General things to consider when looking at job openings: [その求人の募集背景、理解してますか？](https://stand.fm/episodes/64730d47dd3063cef8315ccb)
* Introductions to types of jobs: [データサイエンティストってどんな仕事？](https://stand.fm/episodes/60b42f12a9cdfb1ccf71ff00)
* Nice to know and interesting stuff: [ホワイト500という称号](https://stand.fm/episodes/6559617d96ef49197f7c856e)

Regarding the other platforms, [CareerCross](https://www.careercross.com/) lets you search by required Japanese and English level which is nice for multilingual job seekers, [JREC-IN](https://jrecin.jst.go.jp/) is aimed at academic jobs and challenge in terms of UI/UX, and [TokyoDev](https://www.tokyodev.com/)/[japandev](https://japan-dev.com/) have lots of job openings that don’t require Japanese.

In addition to job platforms, I also directly searched on company websites. In a hope to capitalize on my mother tongue I looked into German companies that might offer the kinds of jobs I’m looking for on Japan. Additionally, because I care about open source, I searched on websites of some of the sponsors of the [Open Source Summit Japan](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/open-source-summit-japan/). In the same vein, I also simply searched the Web for companies embracing/endorsing/appreciating open source. Funnily, this arguably least sophisticated method led me to an article, [OSS活動に理解のある企業](https://findy-code.io/pick-up/articles/understanding-of-oss_2), which in the end led me to my future employer. ^_^'

Overall, the job hunting process went like this: [**flow diagram of the job search process**](/assets/img/blog/shyuukatsu_2024_sankey.png)

* using all of these job platforms definitely had some merit and laded me a first few interviews which helped getting experience
