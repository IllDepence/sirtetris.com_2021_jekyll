After having been to Japan as [an exchange student](/s/MYJ15), [a research intern](/s/NII17), [a tou](/a/f29d4d64)[rist](/a/87696676), and [a visiting PhD student](/s/UTYO22), I’m adding another type of visa and status of residence to the list. This time, it will be a work visa — specifically, a [highly skilled professional visa](https://www.mofa.go.jp/j_info/visit/visa/long/visa16.html) (HSP). Below, I’ll write about the job hunting process, visa acquisition, and preparations for moving.

**🔍 Job hunting from abroad** — fresh master’s graduate  
In early 2019, I had my first experience with hunting for a job in Japan from abroad. The plan back then was to line up a job for when I’d finish my master’s. Going by old notes, I could reconstruct the following.

* Material
    * [Japanese “fill-in style” CV](https://github.com/shigio/rireki-style)
    * [Online CV](https://github.com/pages-themes/minimal)
* Searched on
    * [indeed](https://jp.indeed.com/)
    * [Wantedly](https://jp.wantedly.com/)
    * [Daijob](https://www.daijob.com/)
* Application process
    * 7 job openings I applied for
    * 2 companies I had interviews with <!-- included 職務適正検査 and 課題 -->
    * 1 job offer

The jobs I applied for were in software engineering (NLP, web, etc.), data science, and system administration. The offer I got was for a web development position. In the end though, I also got offered a PhD position in Germany on short notice, which I ended up taking.

**🔍 Job hunting from abroad** — PhD with some job experience  
Doing a PhD had not really been among the paths I had considered for moving forward. Because of that, taking the unexpected offer didn’t mean to me calling off Japan, but simply putting the move on hold for a bit. Accordingly, I reinitiated the job hut as the finish line slowly but surely came into view. While I did not completely rule out academic positions (e.g. a postdoc), I primarily searched for industry jobs again.

About a year before my estimated finishing date, I updated my English LinkedIn profile, set it to “open for work”, and started to occasionally browse [TokyoDev](https://www.tokyodev.com/) to get a first feeling for sought out skills, typical work conditions, etc. During this phase, I got contacted by one bilingual recruiter on LinkedIn and had some helpful discussions. However, since it still was quite some time until I’d be available to start a job, we didn’t get into any application processes.

After about half a year of “passive mode” I switched gears into actively preparing and applying. First things first, I translated my [CV](https://github.com/barraq/pandoc-moderncv) to Japanese — no typical “fill-in form style” CV though; kind of felt like a thing for fresh graduates. Then I looked for job platforms to use. (sth sth right search terms/buzzwords (full remote, flex time, open source focus, ...)
