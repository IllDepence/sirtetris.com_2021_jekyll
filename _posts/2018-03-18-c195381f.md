Month five of <s>six</s> *nine!*

Anki was not bad; sport very much insufficient; most importantly though my stay got extended by 3 months. :) Time to take a step back, shake off the *oh no I'm leaving in a few weeks* mindset and take a deep breath. :3

Anyway, here's the listy thing:

* general
    * went to a meetup for people interested in i18n/l10n innovations and found myself walking up to a nice reception lady in front of a room with classic music playing and not a single person not wearing a suit in it — until I entered, that is. After reassurance of the event's host that this is a casual get-together, an immensely butchered self introduction to the group from my side, free Dr. Pepper and some interesting presentations, the following <span class="mixlang"><span class="swap" swap="informal get-together (in this context the informal part at a bar after the formal presentation part of the event)"><span class="inner">懇親会</span></span></span> was great though. Exchanged a lot of <span class="mixlang"><span class="swap" swap="business cards"><span class="inner">名刺</span></span></span> and had good conversations with the folks there
    * had my frist proper VR experience (as in not just a headset) in the form of a [planetarium / VR attraction](http://megastarjourney.com/about.html) using a Japanese VR system called [ABAL](https://www.abal.jp/)
    * watched Stranger Things, <span class="mixlang"><span class="swap" swap="the 3rd Chihayafuru movie"><span class="inner">ちはやふる -結び-</span></span></span> and way too much AoE2 videos on YouTube
    * finally did some [geocaching](/assets/img/blog/nii_add_07.jpg) in the area where I'm living currently
* at the institute
    * diving deep into linked data stuff lately (if someone knows how to configure a few arbitrary\* inference rules for data stored and accessed through a Fuseki 3.6 instance *PLEASE* tell me)<br>\*meaning not just RDFS or OWL statements
    * arranged my workspace as a standing desk (very improvised but it works)

On to the *not last* month!
