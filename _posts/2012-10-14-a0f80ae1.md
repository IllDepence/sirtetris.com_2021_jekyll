[The renovation cat](/a/dc18fc96) must have sent it's friend. â€” I used the last two days to update the site a bit.

Blog section is now full width, manually chosen permalinks have been replaced by hashes, content has been restructured, the design changed a bit, spam protection is now done with reCAPTCHA, etc.  
Future plans are to build the site so that it functions perfectly fine w/o JavaScript but, when enabled, makes good use of its benefits, heavily extend the interests section as implied there, etc. However, I guess it's going to take a while until I really find the time to make noticable changes again. I have a lot less free time than I'm used to atm and that's not going to change until February or so. :/
