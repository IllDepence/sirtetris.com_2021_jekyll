Eight months in Japan; another review:

The new semester started. This time I take 4 Japanese classes (reading, discussion, practical appilcation, business) as well as one grad school class on intercultural communication and an undergrad seminar on game development. While the latter is targeted at total beginners and therefore not *that* interesting for me content wise, it *is* Japanese targeted at Japanese and therefore super useful listening practice.

Apart from lectures there's a steady flow of events, activities, occurrences that keeps me busy and happy. I participated in [Ludum Dare 35](https://youtu.be/XLC6Lz0eKt4), did some English language instruciton/training at a local NGO, started [speed cubing](https://youtu.be/AI63Md4cZCE) again — at least for a day ^^ —,  helped [flying a kite](/assets/img/blog/myj15_add14.gif) at a [kite flying festival](/assets/img/blog/myj15_add15.jpg), etc. etc.

Side note: the two JK energetically playing a huge taiko was the best thing ever (see title image, also taken at the kite festival).

Good stuff.

On to the next month!
